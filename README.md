Coffee Taster, Final Project for 'Code in Place 2021'

The world of coffee is so diverse and fascinating that I decided to dedicate my final project to this topic. 

Coffee Taster is a program that shows countries on a map depending on how their coffee tastes. It takes a name of a broad taste category (acidic, sweet, or bitter) from a user, and then it gives back a picture filtered by color associated with a flavor. It also prints out names of those countries and more detailed taste descriptors.
